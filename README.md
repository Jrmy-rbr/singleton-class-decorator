# robust-singleton-decorator

This repo implements a decorator that creates singleton classes. As opposed to some other singleton decorators,
the singleton classes created through this decorator are true classes. As a consequence,
every operation supported by classes is supported by the singleton classes, like the use of `isinstance` for example.
